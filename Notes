Intial brain dump for intellitank3

Powered by 9 12v 1A LED Chips 6 white and 3 blue(night) - These are very bright (and very hot) over comes the issue of to many LED's not enough light.

System will be powered by a 24v 5A+ reg psu.
High power transistors have been ordered.

The 8Seg display will be powered by the 7219max chip allowing the MCU to do other more important stuff than muxing a display.
I will use LEDs in the control unit to show what the display is dissplaying, using 8seg displays seriously inhibits letters
so 
blue = tank temp
red = room temp and possibly humidity, if i can get it on the display (8 chars X 8 segs).
I would like to see if I can monitor anything else in the tank water PH etc would be awesome (but expensive).

I am going to buy a PSU that I can put inside the plasic enclosure so that everything is in a neat package.


Features -
room temp and hum 
water temp
PIR person detection

The unit will not have a RTC this just caused more bother than it was worth - Just three modes:
FULL - A person has been seen so lights on full - probably 1 hr
DAWN (Half white and half blue) - This will occur after the timeout. - 30mins
NIGHT - This is mainly blue light, this is out standby mode. - until person seen again.

no bluetooth, I just simply never used this.

I may have to monitor the temperature under the hood as the LED chips get VERY hot. though Im hoping to combat this by never having them
at full power. (PWM)

Molex for connecting the lights to the control unit  probably a an external plug and socket on end of cable so I can easily remove the lid 
as the lights will be attached.
